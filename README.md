# Crop Prediction Model using Federated Learning

## Overview

This repository contains the code for a crop prediction model developed using federated learning. The model is currently under research and development, and its details will be shared at a later stage.

## Introduction

Federated learning is a privacy-preserving machine learning approach where the model is trained across decentralized devices or servers holding local data samples without exchanging them. This project explores the application of federated learning to crop prediction, aiming to improve prediction accuracy while respecting data privacy.

## Features

- **Federated Learning:** Utilizes federated learning techniques for training the crop prediction model across distributed devices or servers.
- **Modular Architecture:** The code is structured in a modular fashion, allowing easy extension and customization.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** The project includes a Jupyter Notebook for interactive exploration, analysis, and visualization of the federated learning process.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Dataset


## Usage

The Jupyter Notebook contains step-by-step instructions on how to:
- Load and preprocess the dataset
- Implement the federated learning algorithm
- Train and evaluate the crop prediction model
- Visualize the results
